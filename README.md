# Replicas of the Statue of Liberty Around the World
Since it was dedicated in 1886, many have created replicas of the Statue of Liberty around the world. I always found it interesting finding replicas of the Statue of Liberty outside of New York, and thought it would be nice to have a map of notable replicas.\
This repository contains code, in the folder `src`, written by [myself](https://github.com/mtoyohara) in 2019 (with help from a college friend), to scrape coordinates and other data from [Waymarking](https://www.waymarking.com/), a website for posting interesting and unique locations. \
The end goal for this project is to integrate the data set into an application like Google Maps to enable routing and visualize replica locations.
